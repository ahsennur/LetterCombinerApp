This project includes a method combineLetter which takes two integer array and two strings as it's parameters.Sequentialy the method takes the first array's integers,call it k for each iteration,then concatenates first string's kth char to combined string then does same thing on the second array and string returns combined string if nothing unexpected happens.0 is ignored as an array element thus combined string remains same.
If any integer exceeds the length of the string which it's been mapped, this is an out of bound error.
Parameter strings cannot be empty.
Any char to be added to combined string must be a letter.
